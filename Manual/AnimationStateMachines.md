# 动画状态机

<!-- It is common for a character or other animated Game Object to have several different animations that correspond to different actions it can perform in the game. For example, a character may breathe or sway slightly while idle, walk when commanded to and raise its arms in panic as it falls from a platform. A door may have animations for opening, closing, getting jammed, and being broken open. Mecanim uses a visual layout system similar to a flow-chart, to represent a **state machine** to enable you to control and sequence the animation clips that you want to use on your character or object. This section gives further details about Mecanim’s state machines and explains how to use them. -->

在游戏中，一个角色或其他动画游戏对象通常具有多个对应不同行为的动画剪辑。例如，一个角色在空闲时可能会呼吸或轻微摇摆，当收到命令时开始行走，从平台跌落时惊慌地抬起手臂。一扇门可以具有打开、关闭、卡住和被砸开动画。动画系统使用一种类似于流程图的可视系统来表示**状态机**，是使你可以控制和序列化想要应用在角色或游戏对象上的动画剪辑。本章提供了有关动画系统的状态机的更多内容，并介绍如何使用它们。
